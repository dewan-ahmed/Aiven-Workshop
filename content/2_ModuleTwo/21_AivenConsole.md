# Get familiar with the Aiven console

![Aiven Console](/images/aiven_console.png)

This is the [Aiven console](https://console.aiven.io/) which you can access with the account you set up in the previous step. The center of the page displays your services and the left navigation offers other menu options like viewing event logs or checking out your account billing. 

The **Create service** button on the top-right corner is something you'll interact a lot with if you create services from the console.
