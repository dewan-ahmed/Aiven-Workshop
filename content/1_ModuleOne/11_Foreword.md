# Foreword 

What do we mean by data infrastructure? Data infrastructure includes all of your services to store, transmit, and monitor the data. This can include a relational database like PostgreSQL®, a key-value store like Redis®* or Apache Cassandra®, data streaming service like Apache Kafka®, or a visualization service like Grafana®. 

Most engineering teams have disparate services running for their data services which make provisioning, configuring, and monitoring incredibly difficuly. With Aiven platform, you can deploy Apache Kafka®, Apache Cassandra®, PostgreSQL®, Apache Flink® beta, ClickHouse® (beta), OpenSearch®, MySQL, Redis®*, InfluxDB®, Grafana®, and M3 - all available in more than 23 AWS regions around the world and manageable from one single Aiven platform.

However, it's difficult to scale when you create services from a web console or via custom scripts. That's why, Terraform Provider for Aiven will help you build, configure, and tear down your infrastructure declaratively. Terraform is HashiCorp’s open source infrastructure as code tool that lets you define resources and infrastructure in human-readable files and manages your infrastructure’s lifecycle.

In the next section, you will set up an Aiven account and get familiar with the Aiven console.
