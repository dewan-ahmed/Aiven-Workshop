# Install Terraform 

From [this page](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli), you can perform either a manual installation or an installation using your operating system's package manager.

To ensure that the installation process worked, execute the following command on your terminal which should output the Terraform version.

```
terraform version
```
