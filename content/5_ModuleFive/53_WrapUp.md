# Wrap up

In this workshop, you learned about infrastructure as code in a hands-on way using the Aiven platform and Aiven Terraform Provider. You created multiple data services using the console and Terraform. Finally, you leveraged the power of Terraform variables and configurations to build repeatable development and production data infrastructure.

If you haven't already, [sign up with Aiven](https://console.aiven.io/signup) to build and manage your data infrastructure based on open-source technologies. And don't forget to check out Aiven on AWS Marketplace:
