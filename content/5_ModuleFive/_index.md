# Repeatable dev-->prod data infrastructure

Congratulations on completing all four modules so far. You have accomplished a ton! Let's take a look back:

- You learned how to create an Aiven account and install Terraform
- You created your first Aiven service on AWS from the Aiven console
- You created single and multiple Aiven services on AWS using Aiven Terraform Provider
- You built a development environment consisting of multiple data related services using Terraform

### Coming up - Build repeatable production environment for your data infrastructure
In the next few sections, you'll use Terraform to build your production environment data infrastructure which will almost mirror the development environment.
